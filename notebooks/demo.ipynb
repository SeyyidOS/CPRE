    "This is the first section of the FEN string and describes the positions of all pieces on the board, starting from the 8th rank (black’s back rank) down to the 1st rank (white’s back rank).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Letters** represent pieces:\n",
    "  - Uppercase for white pieces (`R` for rook, `N` for knight, `B` for bishop, `Q` for queen, `K` for king, `P` for pawn).\n",
    "  - Lowercase for black pieces (`r`, `n`, `b`, `q`, `k`, `p`).\n",

    "### 1. **Flattening the Chess Board**\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach involves transforming the chess board's position, represented in FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation), into a flattened feature vector. Each square on the board is treated as an individual feature, and the following encoding is applied:\n",
    "- **Empty squares**: Represented by the value `0`.\n",
    "- **Occupied squares**: Represented by the ASCII code of the piece occupying the square. For example:\n",
    "  - `Q` (White Queen): ASCII code `81`.\n",
    "  - `q` (Black Queen): ASCII code `113`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By representing the chess board as a fixed-length vector, this method enables traditional machine learning algorithms to process the input efficiently. The simplicity of this approach makes it interpretable and computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Feature Engineering with Graphs**\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach models the chess board as a graph, where:\n",
    "- **Nodes**: Represent individual pieces on the board.\n",
    "- **Edges**: Represent possible interactions or relationships between pieces, such as attack and defense patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this graph representation, advanced feature engineering techniques are applied to extract meaningful insights about piece dynamics and positional strength. A tree-based model (e.g., Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest) is then trained on these engineered features to predict the puzzle ratings. This approach emphasizes the relational and positional aspects of the game, which are often critical for understanding puzzle difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **CNN-GRU Modeling**\n",
    "\n",
    "This deep learning-based approach combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to leverage both spatial and temporal aspects of chess puzzles:\n",
    "- **CNNs**: Used for feature extraction from the chess board. The 2D structure of the board is treated as an image-like input, enabling the CNN to identify patterns such as piece configurations and interactions.\n",
    "- **GRUs**: Used to process the sequence of moves in the puzzle. GRUs capture temporal dependencies and sequential information inherent in move sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating CNNs and GRUs, this method captures both the static board position and the dynamic sequence of moves, making it well-suited for complex puzzles.\n",
